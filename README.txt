This is the code for a simple single webpage meant to be hosted on github pages, for my srcmake website.

It's meant to be designed as a landing page, but may change in the future. I'm just experimenting.

The source code for this project was provided with by Traversy Media. You can see the tutorial (here on his youtube)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZv8YHYUHTU].

I'm leaving his license as a file in this project.
